-All logging should have a structured JSON response. E.g., console.log(JSON.stringify({
  event: 'user_registered',
  userId: user.id,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
}));
-logging is important. here is a rule of thumb of what needs to be captured by logging: 
Rule of thumb:
-Log errors always.
-Log major lifecycle events (startup, shutdown, deploys).
-Log key business events (user signup, payment attempt, job completed).
-Don’t log every single function call — that’s too noisy.
-all changes MUST (no exceptions) be made on a feature branch. This feature branch then uses a staging called develop on github where i will merge this feature branch into the staging branch and eventually into main which is my prod branch
